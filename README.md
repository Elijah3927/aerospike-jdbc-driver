## Motivation

Simplify access to Aerospike DB.

## Introduction

[Aerospike](https://www.aerospike.com/) is extremely fast and scalable key-value store. It provides clients for various languages including Java. However unlike relational databases that all support SQL and therefore can easily implement JDBC driver each no-SQL DB creates its own world. API exposed by clients of no-SQL databases are different (not standard) and optimized for specific features of certain databases. 

From other hand threre are a lot of tools that help to visualize data stored in database, create reports based on the data, perform various ETL operations etc. These tools traditionally support SQL. Database that has standards complient JDBC driver can be easilty connected to various tools. Majority of popular no-SQL databased have JDBC drivers. Aerospike did not have one. This was the reason to start this project.
